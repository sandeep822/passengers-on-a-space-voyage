# passengers-on-a-space-voyage

information about passengers on a space voyage, including details like their PassengerId, HomePlanet, whether they were in CryoSleep during the journey, Cabin details, Destination, Age, VIP status, and amenities they utilized during the trip such as RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck. The "Transported" column likely indicates whether the passenger was successfully transported to their destination. Each row corresponds to a different passenger, detailing their journey characteristics. For instance, Passenger 0002_01 from Earth utilized various amenities, including RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, and VRDeck, and was successfully transported to TRAPPIST-1e. On the other hand, Passenger 9278_01 was from Earth, didn't use any amenities, and their transportation status is unclear. Overall, the dataset seems to capture diverse aspects of passengers' experiences and outcomes during space travel.
